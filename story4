Level 5: Coronation Ceremony of Future Pharaohs

Location: Altar on the outskirts of Cairo
Background: The time rift is completely chaotic, and ancient Egypt and future technology are intertwined: there are floating cars in the sky, and satellite antennas are installed at the top of pyramids.

Unreasonable items:

Suspended Throne - The pharaoh sits on an anti gravity seat manufactured by future technology.

Holographic Projection Crown - The crown is composed of a beam of light, emitting blue light.

News unmanned camera - a robot floating in the air to shoot "live broadcasts".

Plot point (ending):
Kobayashi discovered the last energy fragment beneath the throne and successfully restored the machine, causing all technological items to disappear instantly.
He returned to the modern laboratory, only to find a photo of a pyramid still on the table - a blurry drone shadow in the corner... (open-ended ending)
