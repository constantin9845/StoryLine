Xiao Lin, a curious high school student, accidentally activates a malfunctioning time machine in his school’s science lab.  
The machine goes haywire and sends him randomly across different countries and historical eras!

Ancient emperors are using smartphones, medieval knights are skateboarding, and robots are cooking dumplings in the future.
To fix the time machine and return home, Xiao Lin must spot everything that doesn’t belong in each timeline.
