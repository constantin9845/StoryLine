Level 3: The Monastery Library

Scene: Light filters through stained glass as Xiaolin enters a quiet stone room filled with scrolls and ancient books. But mixed among the relics are strange, glowing items.
Irregularities:
	1.	A monk is typing on a laptop.
	2.	A knight reads a printed magazine with glossy pages.
	3.	A desk lamp flickers beside a pile of manuscripts.
Story hint:
Xiaolin: “A laptop… a lamp… a magazine? Even the monks have gone digital!”
