Level 5: The Town Square Rift

Scene: Xiaolin steps into a foggy town square where knights, monks, and peasants gather around a fire. Everything seems ordinary… until he looks closer.
Irregularities:
	1.	A microwave sits beside the campfire.
	2.	A coffee cup and an electric fan rest on a wooden table.
	3.	A modern baseball cap lies next to parchment scrolls.
Story hint:
Xiaolin: “A microwave in the Middle Ages!? This is the last crack before the next jump — I can feel it!”
