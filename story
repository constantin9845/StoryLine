Level 1: The Knight’s Chamber

Scene: Xiaolin wakes up in a medieval knight’s room. Stone walls, flickering candles, and armor line the walls — but something feels off.
Irregularities:
	1.	A Starbucks coffee cup sits on the wooden desk.
	2.	A digital clock blinks “7:43” beside a pile of scrolls.
	3.	A plastic water bottle glows faintly in the candlelight.
Story hint:
Xiaolin: “A coffee cup and a digital clock… in the Middle Ages? Something’s definitely wrong here!”
