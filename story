Plot Overview:
When Xiaolin was transported to ancient Egypt, he discovered that the core fragments of the time machine were scattered across this mysterious land. To repair the machine, he had to identify items that "belonged to a different era" in each scene and correct the temporal disruptions. For every three incorrect items he found, he could restore a portion of the machine's energy.

Location: Giza Plateau
Background: Xiao Lin saw workers hauling stones to build a pyramid, yet the construction site exuded an eerie modern vibe.

Unreasonable items:

Xiao Lin discovered the fragments of the time machine hidden in the freezer. After retrieving them, the machine restored its initial energy, and a temporal rift transported him to a new timeline.
