Level 2: The Market of Time

Scene: Xiaolin steps out of the chamber and finds himself in a bustling medieval market. Merchants shout, horses trot, and bread is baking — yet the scene hides oddities.
Irregularities:
	1.	A child is playing with a handheld game console.
	2.	A merchant carries a plastic shopping bag with a modern logo.
	3.	A shiny bicycle leans against a stone wall.
Story hint:
Xiaolin: “Game consoles and plastic bags in a medieval market? Time’s all tangled up!”
