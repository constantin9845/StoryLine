Level 4: The Carpenter’s Workshop

Scene: Sawdust fills the air. The rhythmic sound of hammering echoes through a medieval workshop — but the tools look far too advanced.
Irregularities:
	1.	The carpenter is using an electric drill.
	2.	A toaster and a travel mug sit beside the sawdust.
	3.	An apprentice is secretly playing a Game Boy.
Story hint:
Xiaolin: “A toaster in the Middle Ages? I’m not fixing furniture here — I’m fixing time!”
