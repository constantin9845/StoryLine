Level 4: The Future Clinic of Mummies

Location: Inside the Mausoleum of the Valley of the Kings
Background: Kobayashi saw the priest "treating" the mummy, but the tomb looked like a modern hospital.

Unreasonable items:

X-ray machine - used to "check" the condition of the mummy's wrapping.

Disposable medical masks - all priests wear blue masks.

Vending machine - placed next to the tomb door, selling energy drinks.

Plot points:
The interior of the vending machine is a hiding place for energy fragments. After being removed, the machine flashes again and time begins to twist violently.
